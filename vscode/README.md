# New Relic CodeStream

Shift left by making code performance part of the earliest stages of the development process. 

- Get performance data for individual methods in the code, including notifications about poorly performing methods.
- Get actionable information, such as errors, vulnerabilities and non-compliant SLOs, for the services built from your code.
- Investigate errors more quickly by stepping through the stack trace and collaborating with teammates.

### Integrations

- **Issue Trackers:** Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Jira, Linear, Shortcut, Trello, YouTrack
- **Messaging Services:** Slack, Microsoft Teams

### Requirements

- CodeStream requires a current version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and is also available for [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream) or [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs-22).
- Your repository must be managed by Git, or a Git hosting service like GitHub or GitLab.

# Code-Level Metrics

See performance data, at the method level, right in your editor. Always-on view ensures that performance issues are factored into the work at hand. You can even see metrics for your lower environments, and head off performance issues before they hit production.

# Investigate Errors

Discover errors happening in the code youâ€™re responsible for. Quickly step through the stack trace, with CodeStream automatically taking you to the correct file and line number, then bring relevant teammates into the discussion so that you can resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

# Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

Get an in-IDE view of how the services built from your code are performing, in any environment. Golden metrics, service-level objectives and related services give you the big picture at a glance.
